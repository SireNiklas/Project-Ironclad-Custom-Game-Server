Ironclad SignalR server implementation.

Seperated into respective projects that share nessasary resources.

(This build may or may not run, I beleive I broke something recently as of now I have been sick and haven't been able to touch it for a few days so I am unsure)


If attempting to run this project please run the server api first THEN the client console app. (Client Core is the actual heavy lifter for everything as I wanted to make it modular same for Server Core)
